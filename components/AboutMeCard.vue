        Hi, I'm a Fullstack Developer with a focus on Frontend and Web-Development, specifically UI/UX, functionality
        and clean code. With over 12 years in the business and 7 years of professional experience, I have a good
        understanding of diverse frontend topics such as Styleguides, Accessibility, Responsive Design, and
        Component-Driven Development. Most of this experience was done in Vue.js with SCSS or Tailwind, as well as
        Storybook on larger projects, including React and Next.js on a smaller scale. Also working on backend
        technologies is nothing new for me as I've already built diverse API's and Microservices, as well as helped with
        the architecture of complex systems.
