        Hi, I'm a Frontend/Fullstack Developer with a focus on Web-Development, specifically UI/UX, functionality and
        clean code.
      </p>
      <p class="font-paragraph text-lg will-change-contents md:text-xl">
        With over 7 years of professional experience, I have a good understanding of diverse frontend topics such as
        Styleguides, Accessibility, Responsive Design, and Component-Driven Development.
      </p>
      <p class="font-paragraph text-lg will-change-contents md:text-xl">
        Most of this experience was done in Vue.js with SCSS or Tailwind, as well as Storybook on larger projects,
        including React and Next.js on a smaller scale.
      </p>
      <p class="font-paragraph text-lg will-change-contents md:text-xl">
        Also working on backend technologies is nothing new for me as I've already built diverse API's and
        Microservices, as well as helped with the architecture of complex systems.
